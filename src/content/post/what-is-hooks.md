# What is Hooks?

Hooks are a new addition to React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

Hooks are functions that let you "hook" into React state and lifecycle features from function components.

Hooks don't work inside classes â€” they let you use React without classes.

Hooks are backwards-compatible.

Hooks are 100% JavaScript. They don't require any new JavaScript features.

## Rules of Hooks

- Only call Hooks at the top level. Don't call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
- Only call Hooks from React function components. Don't call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions.

## Hooks API

- useState
- useEffect
- useContext
- useReducer
- useCallback
- useMemo
- useRef
- useImperativeHandle
- useLayoutEffect
- useDebugValue

## Custom Hooks

Custom Hooks are regular functions that start with the word "use".

Custom Hooks are a way to reuse stateful logic between components.
